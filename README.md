# Module Two Challenge

## Description

We were tasked with building a portfolio page from scratch by applying concepts covered in Module Two.
This project focused mostly on our use of CSS styling using flexbox, application of pseudo-elements/classes/variables, media queries, and other CSS properties to meet our Acceptance Criteria (see below). 

**Disclaimer:**
At the time of submission, all projects are placeholders. This portfolio will be updated as the bootcamp progresses.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
